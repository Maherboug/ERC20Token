# ERC20Token
This is an example in solidity language of an ERC-20 standard Ethereum Token (StarDucks Capu-Token). We will create a Token that will allow you to redeem a coffee at your favorite coffee shop in Duckburg: StarDucks Coffee. Because coffee is hardly divisible, it will look slightly different from other ERC20 tokens, but it will still be transferable.
#Erc-20 implementation
ERC-20 is a standard interface for creating fungible tokens.
